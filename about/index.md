# About osm2pgsql

Osm2pgsql is an Open Source tool for importing
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/){:.extlink} (OSM) data into a
PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. Essentially it is a very specialized ETL
(Extract-Transform-Load) tool for OpenStreetMap data. [PostgreSQL
database](https://www.postgresql.org/){:.extlink} is the most advanced Open
Source database, together with the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/){:.extlink}
extension for handling geographical data it offers an extremely powerful
way of working with OpenStreetMap data.

Osm2pgsql is an essential part of many services that take OSM data and create
maps from it. It is also used in the Nominatim geocoder and numerous other
applications processing OSM data.
