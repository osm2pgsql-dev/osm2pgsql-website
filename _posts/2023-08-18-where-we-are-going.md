title: Where We are Going
---

Development of an Open Source project is often driven by the current need for
some features. But we also have frequent discussions about the long-term
development of the project. Where do we need or want to go? How do all the
different features fit together to make a coherent whole? What feature can we
work on now that makes sense on its own but can also later be a part of
something bigger?

To help with this big-picture view we maintain a kind of [road
map](https://osm2pgsql.org/about/road-map.html). It is by no means
complete, and always changing, but it gives you some idea on where we are and
where we want to go.

For even more "out there" ideas we just added a new [project ideas
list](https://osm2pgsql.org/contribute/project-ideas.html). These are the ideas
we want to work on eventually, but that are too large to do in a few hours here
or there. Maybe you want to help working on one of these? Or help with funding
the development?
