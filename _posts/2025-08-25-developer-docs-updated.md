title: Updated Contributor Docs
---

Over the last few weeks we have updated and overhauled the "Contributing"
section on the osm2pgsql website. We want to make it easier for users and
contributors to understand what our plans are for osm2pgsql, what are the
open issues and what you can do to help.

The new [Contributing Overview]({% link contribute/index.md %}) no longer
focuses on coding because there are so many more ways to help the project
than with code. Whether you are a user, have ideas on improving the
documentation, or want to show your use case, everything helps to make
osm2pgsql better.

We have also updated the [road map]({% link about/road-map.md %}) with the
most important milestones for getting to the next major release 3. If you
are looking at a concrete project to work on, have a look at the updated
[project ideas]({% link contribute/project-ideas.md %}).
