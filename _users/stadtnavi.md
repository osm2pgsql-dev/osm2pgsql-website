Stadtnavi is an Open Source app for smartphones and for the web made for towns
and cities. The app gives visitors and citizens access to intermodal transport
information and many points of interest. It is widely configurable for the
needs of each individual location.

Stadtnavi uses osm2pgsql to import OpenStreetMap points of interest data into a
database from which vector tiles are generated.
