Osm2pgsql is used by the European Institute for Energy Research to process
OpenStreetMap data for various projects involving suitability of sites for
renewable energy projects, urban mobility, and more. They appreciate the
ability to quickly and easily construct customized OpenStreetMap databases that
suit the specific needs of individual projects with the new flex output
feature.

The image shows geographic buffers calculated on features from an
osm2pgsql-based database to exclude unacceptable areas to construct wind
turbines according to national regulation.
