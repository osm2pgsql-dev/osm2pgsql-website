Bellingcat is an independent investigative collective of researchers,
investigators and citizen journalists. As part of their work they often need
to find where some photo was taken.

So they built a tool for searching OpenStreetMap data to help geolocate images
and identify starting points for geolocation investigations, based on objects
and structures you can identify in an image. This tool uses osm2pgsql
internally.
