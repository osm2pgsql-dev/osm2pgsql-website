# Sponsors

Developing and supporting osm2pgsql takes a huge amount of effort. We thank the
following companies and organizations for their support:

We need more and ongoing sponsorship to keep osm2pgsql as a reliable and modern
software. If you want to help, contact a developer of your choice directly. We
can discuss options with you.

We are currently not set up to receive small donations. If you want to donate
small amounts of money, we suggest you support the [OpenStreetMap
Foundation](https://osmfoundation.org/){:.extlink} or one of its local chapters.
