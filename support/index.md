{:.flright}

If you need help with osm2pgsql, your first destination should be
[community.osm.org](https://community.openstreetmap.org/tag/osm2pgsql){:.extlink}.
Before asking your question, have a look at existing questions about osm2pgsql.
Maybe your question has already been answered. Note that some answers might be
outdated.

When asking for help, always describe what you are trying to achieve *in the
end*. Often a proposed or chosen solution is not the right approach, the
result is that you and other people spend time discussion a solution that
doesn't really fit the problem. This is known as the
[XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/){:.extlink}.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
Keep in mind that osm2pgsql is an Open Source project supported by volunteers,
often in their free time.

If you are having trouble with osm2pgsql and need help, make sure to

* first read the [FAQ]({% link doc/faq.md %})
* update to the [current release]({% link releases/index.md %}) of osm2pgsql
  before asking questions. Many bugs have already been fixed in newer versions.

See the [release notes]({% link releases/index.md %}) and the [Upgrading
appendix in the manual](/doc/manual.html#upgrading) for details.

## Discussing Features and Ideas

You can also ask questions or discuss features and ideas

* using the
  [discussion](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql/discussions){:.extlink}
  feature on GitHub.
* on the [community forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org/tag/osm2pgsql){:.extlink} or
* the [#osm-dev IRC channel](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC){:.extlink}.

Describe the feature you want and give us details about your use case for the
feature. Try to think about how the feature fits into the general road map
of osm2pgsql and what other use cases it could cover. The more universal a
feature request, the more likely it is to be picked up.
