The flex output allows a wide range of configuration options. Here
are some extra tips & tricks.

### Using `create_only` Columns for Postprocessed Data

Sometimes it is useful to have data in table rows that osm2pgsql can't create.
For instance you might want to store the center of polygons for faster
rendering of a label.

To do this define your table as usual and add an additional column, marking
it `create_only`. In our example case the type of the column should be the
PostgreSQL type `GEOMETRY(Point, 3857)`, because we don't want osm2pgsql to
do anything special here, just create the column with this type as is.

```lua
polygons_table = osm2pgsql.define_area_table('polygons', {
    { column = 'tags', type = 'hstore' },
    { column = 'geom', type = 'geometry' },
    { column = 'center', sql_type = 'GEOMETRY(Point, 3857)', create_only = true },
    { column = 'area', type = 'area' },
})
```

After running osm2pgsql as usual, run the following SQL command:

```sql
UPDATE polygons SET center = ST_Centroid(geom) WHERE center IS NULL;
```

If you are updating the data using `osm2pgsql --append`, you have to do this
after each update. When osm2pgsql inserts new rows they will always have a
`NULL` value in `center`, the `WHERE` condition makes sure that we only do
this (possibly expensive) calculation once.

### Creating GENERATED Columns

From version 12 on PostgreSQL supports [GENERATED
columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html){:.extlink}.
You can use these from osm2pgsql with a trick, by adding some "magic" wording
to the `sql_type` in a column definition.

We don't promise that this trick will work forever. Putting anything into
the `sql_type` but a PostgreSQL type is strictly experimental.
{: .note}

It is probably best explained with an example. With this config you create a
polygon table with an additional column `center` that is automatically filled
with the centroid of the polygon added:

```lua
local polygons = osm2pgsql.define_area_table('polygons', {
    { column = 'tags', type = 'jsonb' },
    { column = 'geom', type = 'polygon', not_null = true },
    { column = 'center', create_only = true, sql_type = 'geometry(point, 3857) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (ST_Centroid(geom)) STORED' },
})

function osm2pgsql.process_way(object)
    if object.is_closed then
        polygons:insert({
            tags = object.tags,
            geom = object:as_polygon()
        })
    end
end
```

You could do this specific case simpler and faster by using the `centroid()`
function in Lua. But PostGIS has a lot more interesting functions that you can
use this way. Be sure to read the [PostgreSQL
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html){:.extlink}
about the syntax and functionality of the GENERATED columns.

Make sure you have the `create_only = true` option set on the column, otherwise
this will not work.

### Accessing Environment Variables from Lua

In Lua scripts you can access environment variables with `os.getenv("VAR")`.
The Lua config scripts that osm2pgsql uses are normal Lua scripts, so you
can do that there, too.

### Logging Memory Use of Lua Scripts

Lua scripts can use quite a lot of memory if you are not careful. This is
usually only a problem when using [two-stage processing](#stages). To monitor
how much memory is currently used, use this function:

```lua
function create_memory_reporter(filename, frequency)
    local counter = 0
    local file = io.open(filename, 'w')
    file:write('timestamp,counter,mbyte\n')

    return function()
        if counter % frequency == 0 then
            local mem = collectgarbage('count')
            local ts = os.date('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S,')
            file:write(ts .. counter .. ',' .. math.ceil(mem / 1024) .. '\n')
            file:flush()
        end
        counter = counter + 1
    end
end
```

Then use it to create one or more `memory_reporter`s. The first argument
is the output file name, the second specifies after how many process callbacks
it should trigger the output. Make sure this number is not too small,
otherwise processing will become quite slow.

Here is an example use for the `process_node` callback:

```lua
local mr = create_memory_reporter('/tmp/osm2pgsql-lua-memlog.csv', 10000)

function osm2pgsql.process_node(object)
    mr()
    ...
end
```

You can have one memory reporter for nodes, ways, and relations together or
have separate ones.

### Checking Lua Scripts

If you have the Lua compiler (luac) installed (it comes with the installation
of the Lua interpreter), you can use it to syntax check your Lua scripts
independently of osm2pgsql. Just run `luac -p SCRIPT.lua`.

A script that fails this check will not work with osm2pgsql. But it is only a
syntax check, it doesn't run your script, so the script can still fail when
used in osm2pgsql. But it helps getting rid of the simple errors quickly.

There is also the [luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) linter
program which does a lot more checks. Install with `luarocks install luacheck`,
on Debian/Ubuntu you can use the `lua-checks` package. Then run `luacheck
SCRIPT.lua`.

### Lua Script Performance

A complex Lua flex configuration might mean that osm2pgsql spends quite some
time running your Lua code. Optimizing that code will be important.

You can somewhat increase processing speed by using the LuaJIT compiler, but
you have to compile osm2pgsql yourself, because pre-built osm2pgsql binaries
usually don't use it.

Here are some tips:
* Always use local variables which are cheap. It also makes your code more
  robust.
* Don't do work more than once. Store intermediate results in local variables
  instead of recomputing it. For instance if you need the geometry of an OSM
  object several times, get it once and store it (`local geom =
  object:as_polygon(); local center = geom:centroid()`).

See [Lua Performance Tips](https://www.lua.org/gems/sample.pdf){:.extlink} from
the author of Lua for some in-depth tips on how to improve your Lua code. [This
stackoverflow
question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/154672/what-can-i-do-to-increase-the-performance-of-a-lua-program){:.extlink}
also has some great information.

### Lua Debug Output

Sometimes it is useful to print some debug output from a Lua script. For simple
variables this can easily be done with the Lua built-in `print()` function.

For more complex data you can use the `inspect` Lua library. It is available
from [the source](https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua){:.extlink} or using
[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/kikito/inspect){:.extlink}.
Debian/Ubuntu users can install the `lua-inspect` package.
