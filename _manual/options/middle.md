| Option                                  | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| -i, \--tablespace-index=TABLESPC        | Store all indexes in a separate PostgreSQL tablespace named by this parameter. This allows one to e.g. store the indexes on faster storage like SSDs. This option affects the middle as well as the pgsql output indexes. |
| \--tablespace-slim-data=TABLESPC        | Store the slim mode tables in the given tablespace. |
| \--tablespace-slim-index=TABLESPC       | Store the indexes of the slim mode tables in the given tablespace. |
| -p, \--prefix=PREFIX                    | Prefix for table names (default: `planet_osm`). This option affects the middle as well as the pgsql output table names. |
| -s, \--slim                             | Store temporary data in the database. Without this mode, all temporary data is stored in RAM and if you do not have enough the import will not work successfully. With slim mode, you should be able to import the data even on a system with limited RAM, although if you do not have enough RAM to cache at least all of the nodes, the time to import the data will likely be greatly increased. |
| \--drop                                 | Drop the slim mode tables from the database once the import is complete. This can greatly reduce the size of the database, as the slim mode tables typically are the same size, if not slightly bigger than the main tables. It does not, however, reduce the maximum spike of disk usage during import. It can furthermore increase the import speed, as no indexes need to be created for the slim mode tables, which (depending on hardware) can nearly halve import time. Slim mode tables however have to be persistent if you want to be able to update your database, as these tables are needed for diff processing.
| -C NUM, \--cache=NUM                    | Only for slim mode: Use up to **NUM** MB of RAM for caching nodes. Giving osm2pgsql sufficient cache to store all imported nodes typically greatly increases the speed of the import. Each cached node requires 8 bytes of cache, plus about 10% - 30% overhead. As a rule of thumb, give a bit more than the size of the import file in PBF format. If the RAM is not big enough, use about 75% of memory. Make sure to leave enough RAM for PostgreSQL. It needs at least the amount of `shared_buffers` given in its configuration. Defaults to 800. |
| \--cache-strategy=STRATEGY              | There are a number of different modes in which osm2pgsql can organize its node cache in RAM. These are optimized for different assumptions of the data and the hardware resources available. Currently available strategies are **dense**, **chunked**, **sparse** and **optimized**. **dense** assumes that the node id numbers are densely packed, i.e. only a few IDs in the range are missing / deleted. For planet extracts this is usually not the case, making the cache very inefficient and wasteful of RAM. **sparse** assumes node IDs in the data are not densely packed, greatly increasing caching efficiency in these cases. If node IDs are densely packed, like in the full planet, this strategy has a higher overhead for indexing the cache. **optimized** uses both dense and sparse strategies for different ranges of the ID space. On a block by block basis it tries to determine if it is more effective to store the block of IDs in sparse or dense mode. This is the default and should be typically used. |
| -x, \--extra-attributes                 | Include attributes of each object in the middle tables and make them available to the outputs. Attributes are: user name, user id, changeset id, timestamp and version. |
| \--flat-nodes=FILENAME                  | The flat-nodes mode is a separate method to store slim mode node information on disk. Instead of storing this information in the main PostgreSQL database, this mode creates its own separate custom database to store the information. As this custom database has application level knowledge about the data to store and is not general purpose, it can store the data much more efficiently. Storing the node information for the full planet requires more than 300GB in PostgreSQL, the same data is stored in "only" 50GB using the flat-nodes mode. This can also increase the speed of applying diff files. This option activates the flat-nodes mode and specifies the location of the database file. It is a single large file. This mode is only recommended for full planet imports as it doesn't work well with small imports. The default is disabled. |
| \--middle-schema=SCHEMA                 | *Version >= 1.4.0*{:.version} Use PostgreSQL schema SCHEMA for all tables, indexes, and functions in the middle (default is no schema, i.e. the `public` schema is used). |
| \--middle-way-node-index-id-shift SHIFT | *Version >= 1.4.0*{:.version} Set ID shift for way node bucket index in middle. Experts only. See [Bucket Index for slim mode](#bucket-index-for-slim-mode) for details. |
