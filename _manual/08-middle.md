The middle keeps track of all OSM objects read by osm2pgsql and the
relationships between those objects. It knows, for instance, which nodes are
used by which ways, or which members a relation has. It also keeps track of
all node locations. This information is necessary to build way geometries from
way nodes and relation geometries from members and it is necessary when
updating data, because OSM change files only contain changed objects themselves
and not all the related objects needed for creating an object's geometry.

### The Properties Table

*Version >= 1.9.0*{: .version} Osm2pgsql stores some *properties* into a
database table. This table is always called `osm2pgsql_properties`. It will
be created in the schema set with the `--middle-schema` option, or the `public`
schema by default.

The properties table tracks some settings derived from the command line options
and from the input file(s). It allows osm2pgsql to make sure that updates are
run with compatible options. Versions before 1.9.0 do not create this table
and so they don't offer the checks specified below.

The `osm2pgsql_properties` table contains two columns: The `property` column
contains the name of a property and the `value` column its value. Properties
are always stored as strings, for boolean properties the strings `true` and
`false` are used.

The following properties are currently defined:

| Property                      | Type   | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `attributes`                  | bool   | Import with OSM attributes (i.e. osm2pgsql was run with `-x` or `--extra-attributes`)? |
| `current_timestamp`           | string | Largest timestamp of any object in any of the input file(s) in ISO format (`YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ`). Updated with each data update. |
| `flat_node_file`              | string | Absolute filename of the flat node file (specified with `--flat-nodes`). See below for some details. |
| `import_timestamp`            | string | Largest timestamp of any object in the in the input file(s) in ISO format (`YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ`). Only set for initial import. |
| `prefix`                      | string | Table name prefix set with `-p` or `--prefix`. |
| `replication_base_url`        | string | For replication (see below). |
| `replication_sequence_number` | string | For replication (see below). |
| `replication_timestamp`       | string | For replication (see below). |
| `updatable`                   | bool   | Is this database updatable (imported with `--slim` and without `--drop`)? |
| `version`                     | string | Version number of the osm2pgsql application that did the import. |

When updating an existing database that has an `osm2pgsql_properties` table,
osm2pgsql will check that the command line options used are compatible and will
complain if they are not. Options that are not set on the command line will
automatically be set if needed. So for instance if you import a database
without `-x` but then use `-x` on updates, osm2pgsql will fail with an error
message. If you use `-x` both on import and on update everything is fine. And
if you use `-x` on import but not on update, osm2pgsql will detect that you
used that option on import and also use it on update.

The name of the flat node file specified on the command line is converted to
an absolute file name and stored in the `flat_node_file` property. That means
that osm2pgsql will find that flat node file again even if you start it from
a different current working directory. If you need to move the flat node file
somewhere else, you can do that. The next time you run osm2pgsql, add the
`--flat-nodes` option again with the new file name and osm2pgsql will use the
new name and update the properties table accordingly.

The `current_timestamp` and `import_timestamp` properties are not set if the
input file(s) don't contain timestamps on the OSM objects. (Timestamps in
OSM files are optional, but most OSM files have them.)

The `replication_*` properties reflect the setting of the respective header
fields in the input file on import and are used by
[osm2pgsql-replication](#updating-an-existing-database) to automatically update
the database. That program will also update those fields. If you import
multiple files, these properties will not be set.

The contents of the `osm2pgsql_properties` table are internal to osm2pgsql and
you should never change them. Theres is one exception: You can add your own
properties for anything you need, but make sure to start the property names
with an underscore (`_`). this way the property names will never clash with any
names that osm2pgsql might introduce in the future.

### Database Structure

The middle stores its data in the database in the following tables. The
`PREFIX` can be set with the `-p, --prefix` option, the default is
`planet_osm`. (Note that this option is also interpreted by the pgsql output!)

| Table        | Description   |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| PREFIX_nodes | OSM nodes (not used if the flat node store is used |
| PREFIX_ways  | OSM ways      |
| PREFIX_rels  | OSM relations |
{:.desc}

The names and structure of these tables, colloquially referred to as "slim
tables", are an **internal implementation detail** of osm2pgsql. While they do
not usually change between releases of osm2pgsql, be advised that if you rely
on the content or layout of these tables in your application, it is your
responsibility to check whether your assumptions are still true in a newer
version of osm2pgsql before updating. See [this
issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/issues/230) for a discussion
of this topic.
{:.note}

### Flat Node Store

`--flat-nodes` specifies that instead of a table in PostgreSQL, a binary
file is used as a database of node locations. This should only be used on full
planet imports or very large extracts (e.g. Europe) but in those situations
offers significant space savings and speed increases, particularly on
mechanical drives. 

The file size of the flat nodes file created by osm2pgsql will be approximately 8 bytes * maximum node ID present in the extract, regardless of the size of the original extract. In most cases this is about equivalent or slightly larger than the current size of the [PBF Planet extract](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/).

If you are using the `--drop` option, the flat node file will be deleted
after import.

### Caching

`--cache` specifies how much memory in MB to allocate for caching information.
In `--slim` mode, this is just node positions while in non-slim mode it has to
store information about ways and relations too. The rule of thumb in slim mode
is as follows: use the size of the PBF file you are trying to import or about
75% of RAM, whatever is smaller. Make sure there is enough RAM left for
PostgreSQL. It needs at least the amount of `shared_buffers` given in its
configuration. You may also set `--cache` to 0 to disable node caching
completely. This makes only sense when a flat node file is given and there
is not enough RAM to fit most of the cache.

### Bucket Index for Slim Mode

*Version >= 1.4.0*{: .version} This is only available from osm2pgsql version
1.4.0! It is enabled by default since 1.7.0.

Osm2pgsql can use an index for way node lookups in slim mode that needs a lot
less disk space than earlier versions did. For a planet the savings can be
about 200 GB! Because the index is so much smaller, imports are faster, too.
Lookup times are slightly slower, but this shouldn't be an issue for most
people.

*If you are not using slim mode and/or not doing updates of your database, this
does not apply to you.*

For backwards compatibility osm2pgsql will never update an existing database
to the new index. It will keep using the old index. So you do not have to do
anything when upgrading osm2pgsql.

If you want to use the new index, there are two ways of doing this: The "safe"
way for most users and the "do-it-yourself" way for expert users. Note that
once you switched to the new index, older versions of osm2pgsql will not work
correctly any more.

#### Update for Most Users

*Version >= 1.7.0*{: .version} In versions 1.4.0 to 1.6.0 the index was not
enabled by default. Add `--middle-way-node-index-id-shift=5` as command line
option for these versions. Do not use a number different than 5 unless you
know what you are doing.

If your database was created with an older version of osm2pgsql you might want
to start again from an empty database. Just do a reimport and osm2pgsql will
use the new space-saving index.

#### Update for Expert Users

This is only for users who are very familiar with osm2pgsql and PostgreSQL
operation. You can break your osm2pgsql database beyond repair if something
goes wrong here and you might not even notice.

You can create the index yourself by following these steps:

Drop the existing index. Replace `{prefix}` by the prefix you are using.
Usually this is `planet_osm`:

```sql
DROP INDEX {prefix}_ways_nodes_idx;
```

Create the `index_bucket` function needed for the index. Replace
`{way_node_index_id_shift}` by the number of bits you want the id to be
shifted. If you don't have a reason to use something else, use `5`:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION {prefix}_index_bucket(int8[]) RETURNS int8[] AS $$
  SELECT ARRAY(SELECT DISTINCT unnest($1) >> {way_node_index_id_shift})
$$ LANGUAGE SQL IMMUTABLE;
```

Now you can create the new index. Again, replace `{prefix}` by the prefix
you are using:

```sql
CREATE INDEX {prefix}_ways_nodes_bucket_idx ON {prefix}_ways
  USING GIN ({prefix}_index_bucket(nodes))
  WITH (fastupdate = off);
```

If you want to create the index in a specific tablespace you can do this:

```sql
CREATE INDEX {prefix}_ways_nodes_bucket_idx ON {prefix}_ways
  USING GIN ({prefix}_index_bucket(nodes))
  WITH (fastupdate = off) TABLESPACE {tablespace};
```

#### Id Shift (for Experts)

When an OSM node is changing, the way node index is used to look up all ways
that use that particular node and therefore might have to be updated, too.
This index is quite large, because most nodes are in at least one way.

When creating a new database (when used in create mode with slim option),
osm2pgsql can create a "bucket index" using a configurable id shift for the
nodes in the way node index. This bucket index will create index entries not
for each node id, but for "buckets" of node ids. It does this by shifting the
node ids a few bits to the right. As a result there are far fewer entries
in the index, it becomes a lot smaller. This is especially true in our case,
because ways often contain consecutive nodes, so if node id `n` is in a way,
there is a good chance, that node id `n+1` is also in the way.

On the other hand, looking up an id will result in false positives, so the
database has to retrieve more ways than absolutely necessary, which leads to
the considerable slowdown.

You can set the shift with the command line option
`--middle-way-node-index-id-shift`. Values between about 3 and 6 might make
sense, from some tests it looks like 5 is a good value.

To completely disable the bucket index and create an index compatible with
earlier versions of osm2pgsql, use `--middle-way-node-index-id-shift=0`.
