# Contribute

Osm2pgsql is an Open Source project. Your contributions are welcome. You can
find the source code and issue tracker on
[Github](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql){:.extlink}.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for some information about how to contribute.

There is a kind of [road map]({% link contribute/road-map.md %}) for osm2pgsql
development. It’s not to be understood as a definite “this is what we’ll do”
document, but as a rough and incomplete overview of the shared understanding of
the maintainers about where we are and in what areas we see need for work.

## Tests and Continuous Integration

[![Github Actions Build Status](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/actions)
[![Appveyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7abwls7hfmb83axj/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/branch/master)

We have a growing suite of tests, new features and bug fixes should always
have test coverage.

The `master` branch and all pull requests are checked automatically using
Github Actions (Linux and macOS builds) and Appveyor (Windows builds). (And
yes, this should be unified, but nobody had the time to do that yet.)
