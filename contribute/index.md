# Contribute

Osm2pgsql is an Open Source project. Your contributions are welcome. You can
find the source code and issue tracker on
[Github](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql){:.extlink}. For some
starting points see the
[contribute page](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/contribute).

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for some information about how to contribute.

There is a kind of [road map]({% link contribute/road-map.md %}) for osm2pgsql
development. It’s not to be understood as a definite “this is what we’ll do”
document, but as a rough and incomplete overview of the shared understanding of
the maintainers about where we are and in what areas we see need for work.

See also the [generalization project]({% link generalization/index.md %}).

## Tests and Continuous Integration

[![Github Actions Build Status](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/actions)

We have a growing suite of tests, new features and bug fixes should always
have test coverage.

The `master` branch and all pull requests are checked automatically using
Github Actions (on Linux, macOS and Windows).

## Compatibility

We strive to be out-of-the-box compatible with major Linux distributions to
make use of osm2pgsql as easy as possible for many users. Usually at least
the last long-term release of the major Linux distributions is supported.
This [handy list of dependencies]({% link contribute/dependencies.md %})
helps with that.

We strive to support all versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS that are

* available in the Linux distributions we support, and
* are supported upstream (i.e. from the PostgreSQL and PostGIS teams).
